############### Dobby's Playlist Manual ################

The playlist command is used for handling playlist. To start reproducing a playlist
you will need to use the *play* command (See *play help*).

Usage: 
    (I) playlist <action> <parameters...>
    (II) playlist <playlistname> [option]

Possible actions (I):

    p | play)
        Plays the specified playlist. Syntax: playlist play <playlistname>

    c | create) 
        Creates a playlist. Syntax: playlist create <playlistname> 
    
    d | delete) 
        Deletes an existing playlist. Syntax: playlist delete <playlistname> 
    
    a | add) 
        Adds a song to an exiting playlist. Syntax: playlist add <playlistname> <songname>
    
    r | remove) 
        Removes a song from an existing playlist. Syntax: playlist remove <playlistname> <songname> 
    
    l | list)
        Lists all playlist or all songs in a playlist. Syntax: playlist list | playlist list <playlistname> 

There are some little shortcuts to make things easier: 

    1. **add** and **remove** actions can accepts multiple song by separating them with ':'. 
        Ex: playlist add <playlistname> <song1>:<song2>:<song3> 

    2. **remove** action can be used with both position (see "list" action) or songname. 

Playing a playlist (II)
     
    a | append)
        Appends the playlist to the queue of songs. (Default)

    p | push)
        Deletes all other song in queue and starts playing the playlist. Songs in queue are considered all songs
        that will be listed when using the "CMD_PREFIX + song" command.
    
    
Note that playlistnames should not contain spaces.
