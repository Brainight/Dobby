This is the help manual for executing dobby discord bot. 
Dobby can only be part of one server (guild) and will fail to
execute if he is part of more than one discord server.

Usage: dobby.py [Options]

    Options: 
        -h | --help) 
            Displays this help message.

        -b | --base-dir) 
            Sets the base directory. Dobby won\'t be allowed to create or read 
            files outside this directory. 

        -p | --cmd-prefix) 
            Sets the command prefix. 

        --allow-playlist) 
            Enables the capacity for Dobby to create playlists.
            This option will create a directory 'playlist' in the configured 'base directory'

        --allow-tasks) 
            Enables the capacity for Dobby to create tasks.
            This option will create a directory 'tasks' in the configured 'base directory' 

        --king-role)
            Sets the name of the role that with full privileges.
            Dobby will happily do everything the Server Owner or Members of this group tell him to do.

        --playlist-roles)
            Sets the roles that are able to handle playlists.
            More than one role can be specified. 

        --tasks-roles)
            Sets the roles that are able to handle tasks.
            More than one role can be specified.


Some advanced options:

    **--playlist-roles** and **--tasks-roles** options have the capabilty
    to specify specific permissions for both playlist and tasks handling.
    
    Roles permission can be divided in two:
        
        - Reading (r)
        - Writing (w)

    That means we can specify one of those permissions for every single role. 
    The syntax to apply these permissions is as follows:

        dobby.py --allow-playlist --playlist-roles '<role1>[:<permission>],<role2>[:<permissions>],...'

    By default if no permission is specified users in those roles will only
    be assigned the *reading* permission. Hence *--playlist-roles <role>:r*
    is the same as *--playlist-roles <role>*.


About the discord roles:

    A discord server (aka guild) may have multiple roles with the same name, but different ID.
    Dobby is focused on the roles' names so if two roles have the same name, 
    members of both roles will get the role privileges. In case of the *--king-role*
    modifier, establishing this to a repeated name role will cause an error.
    This means that there is only one possible king role, and one only.


Examples:

    dobby.py -b ~/discord -p '!'


Note that dobby can be execute with a default configuration. 

The default configuration is: 
    Command Prefix = '.'    
    Base Directory = ~ (dobby executing user\'s home directory) 
    Allow Playlist = False
    Allow Tasks = False
    Playlist Role = ()
    Tasks Role = ()
    King Role = 

This configuration can be modified as explained in 'dobby.conf.d/fluffy.conf'

If base_dir is user home directory, dobby will create/use a subfolder ~/.dobby'
