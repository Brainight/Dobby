############### Dobby's Playlist Manual ################

The playlist command is used for handling playlist. To start reproducing a playlist
you will need to use the *play* command (See *play help*).

Usage: playlist <action> <parameters...>

Possible actions:
    
    c | create) 
        Creates a playlist. Syntax: playlist create <playlistname> 
    
    d | delete) 
        Deletes an existing playlist. Syntax: playlist delete <playlistname> 
    
    a | add) 
        Adds a song to an exiting playlist. Syntax: playlist add <playlistname> <songname>
    
    r | remove) 
        Removes a song from an existing playlist. Syntax: playlist remove <playlistname> <songname> 
    
    l | list)
        Lists all playlist or all songs in a playlist. Syntax: playlist list | playlist list <playlistname> 

There are some little shortcuts to make things easier: 

    1. **add** and **remove** actions can accepts multiple song by separating them with ':'. 
        Ex: playlist add <playlistname> <song1>:<song2>:<song3> 

    2. **remove** action can be used with both position (see "list" action) or songname. 

Note that playlistnames cannot contain spaces. 

Permissions:
    *reading*: list and playing
    *writing*: create, delete, add, remove
